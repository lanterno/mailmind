# MailMind — Roadmap

Only outstanding work is listed, re-verified against the tree on 2026-11-10: shipped behaviour is
described in the README and in the code itself, not here. The app is the React one in `web/src`, at `/`,
served by `uv run python -m mailmind serve`. Each item says what is still missing there or on the server.

Items cite functions and symbols rather than line numbers, which drift. Value and effort are
relative to this codebase — S = an afternoon, M = a few days, L = a week-plus.

## Search, rules and organization

- **PDF preview in the Document Hub** · low value · effort M — The Hub previews images in a frame whose sandbox allows nothing
  (`perimeter.attachment_preview_headers`). Chromium won't show a PDF in a sandboxed frame, and a same-origin one would break the
  security model, so a PDF needs a renderer of its own (pdf.js, say), as a new dependency, running with no origin.

## Speed and the connection layer

- **Make a gate for each account the default** · high value · effort S — `MAILMIND_WORKERS=account`
  gives each account its own gate (`mailmind.platform.workers.gates`), so a slow Proton fetch no
  longer blocks archive, send or open on another account; unset, one lock is still every
  account's gate. The whole suite passes under either. The owner soaks it on real accounts, then it
  becomes the default and the flag goes. Then
  give each account's worker the connection it owns (the pool dissolved into it), and split the
  jobs that still pass `gates.EVERY_ACCOUNT`, which wait for every gate: a draft save whose old
  copy is in another account (it needs just the two accounts' gates, which `gates.run` can't take
  yet), and an undo entry that names no account, as a snooze's does (`snooze.undo_entry`), though undoing a snooze asks
  no server anything.
- **Soak IMAPClient on real accounts, then make it the default** · high value · effort S — Waits on
  the owner. `uv run python -m mailmind serve` reaches an account through IMAPClient when its config asks (`"imap_adapter":
  "imapclient"`; the startup line counts them). Both adapters pass the contract against the fake
  and against Dovecot (`just test-dovecot`), and the whole suite passes under either. On real
  Gmail, IMAP and Proton Bridge accounts the two answered every read alike (capabilities, folders,
  status, searches, headers, flags, bodies, IDLE), but nothing has written through IMAPClient
  there yet, nor run on it for days. The owner asks for it on one account, then on all, and uses
  it daily for a week, watching Settings' sync health and the server's output;
  removing the key goes back. Then `front.build` calls `mailbox.use("imapclient")` and the ask
  goes. The command line never comes through `front.build`, so it stays on imaplib until then; it runs on
  the server's packages now, so it can take IMAPClient in the same step, and imaplib's adapter go after it.
- **Turn the connection pool on by default** · high value · effort M — Waits on the owner's soak.
  `Pool` is complete, safety-reviewed and wired into four read call sites (`Ingest.fetch_body`,
  `Folders._live_folder_list` backing the folder rail, `Sweeps.plan` ahead of a sweep, and reconcile's read of UIDs), but
  `Pool._enabled` reads `MAILMIND_POOL`, then each account's `"pool"` key, both unset by default, so every read falls through to a
  fresh session and a logout. Its docstring has a cold Proton body fetch at ~37s, against ~2s warm.
  Remaining: run it on real accounts for days; validate against Proton Bridge (`ProviderProfile`
  recycles a Bridge connection sooner, and `Pool._enabled` leaves Bridge out of the `MAILMIND_POOL=1`
  catch-all, so it has to be listed by address); extend borrowing to mutations (only reads borrow
  today); and default it on.

## The desktop app

- **Proton Mail goes with the desktop app** — decided on 2026-11-08. Proton offers IMAP only through its Bridge, which has
  to run on the same computer as the app, so only a desktop app can count on it. The `proton` account type, the
  `proton_bridge` credential and the loopback handling stay as they are until that app exists; add no new Bridge special cases.

## Open decisions

These are carried forward from the original phase plan because they need a call, not an
implementation.

- **How aggressively to prefetch folders** — on-demand sync bounds disk and first-sync cost, but
  unified-inbox-across-accounts and global search both want broader coverage.
- **Where the data directory lives by default** — `MAILMIND_HOME` names one, and unset it is the repo
  folder, where it has always been. Left for later on 2026-11-03.
- **Default remote-image policy** — block-by-default with per-message "Load images" (current, and the
  privacy-preserving choice) vs. allowing images for known/personal senders.

## Next up

1. **Soak the three defaults, one at a time** (high) — `MAILMIND_WORKERS=account`, then IMAPClient, then `MAILMIND_POOL`. Each
   is written and tested, and waits on days of real use before it becomes the default.
2. **Keep the rest of what is personal in the encrypted database** (high) — the database is encrypted, and the rules, views,
   snippets and audit trails are still files beside it, readable by their owner only. Moved into tables, a copy of the data
   directory holds nothing readable without the Keychain's key. Accounts' inline passwords in `mailmind.config.json` (the
   `plain` credential) would go to the Keychain on the same road.
